From that day forward, he (Callan McAuliffe) tries hard to keep brash and unpredictable Juli (Madeline Carroll) at bay. After six years, she begins to feel that she was wrong about him being the love of her life. Unfortunately, that is just about the time that Bryce begins to think he was wrong about Juli, too.</center></li>

		<li><center> User FH HF said "I stumbled on this movie while browsing through Netflix, and only decided to watch because it was a Rob Reiner film. I have to say that this was a wonderful film and definitely filed under “rewatch again in the future”. If you’ve ever been in love for the first time, this movie will bring back a lot of those feels. I also loved the 50’s setting that brought a nice “Wonder Years” vibe to the film. Anyone who gave this movie a 1 star rating is probably a “flat” person and has the same deep down emotional turmoil and prejudice as Bryce’s dad. For everyone else, this movie will not disappoint."</center></li> </td>

		<li><center>User CHAN MEHTA said "I should say this movie is a masterpiece. I thought, of course, it's another brilliant movie because it has Meryl Streep in it who defines the standards of 'acting'. But I stand corrected. It's not just Meryl Streep who invents a new combination of smug and swag as an upper-classed fashionista boss but it's both her young P.As, Emily Blunt and Anne Hathway who have shown a lot of potential in elegantly sticking up to their roles and doing justice to it. Emily Blunt is simply fantastic and has mimicked the lifestyle of a hard-working underrated desperate personal assistant who awefully ends up to be a great disappointment to her boss against all her efforts. It's so subtle an acting style. Anne Hathway on the other hand has shown a character arc of transitioning from a regular girl to being swayed by a swirl of complex charcaters and personas that work with her and she has to put up with them in order to stay in the job. She goes an extra mile always and gets to decide what's best for her life. The other actors in the movie are well cast too. But Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Anne Hathway just stand out. If you're a connoisseur of fine arts and drama, you should definitely watch it for the over the top performances."</center></li>

When Noah goes off to serve in World War II, it seems to mark the end of their love affair. In the interim, Allie becomes involved with another man (James Marsden). But when Noah returns to their small town years later, on the cusp of Allie's marriage, it soon becomes clear that their romance is anything but over.</center></li>

		<li><center>  User Julie Baker(JullieAllison) said "This is hands down my favorite love story. It dawned on me that I have had great romantic experiences in my life like the ones in this movie. Love letters, reading poetry on a blanket on the beach, great heat and passion, slow dancing and being looked deeply into my eyes while singing a song to me with an emphasis on the lyrics, took baths together and felt each other’s energy, meditated together, and made love, love at first sight, professing love for me after spending only a month together, and one even told me that he loved me more than he loved his kids who he lived for and that was only after a month. None of these relationships worked out, and this tumultuous, codependent, toxic relationship between Noah and Allie never would either. I still adore the movie as I still have issues with codependency, not filling worthy of healthy love, still looking for a great looking guy, which at 50 is impossible to find, still looking for a daddy to love me, approve and take care of me, etc. Thus, I remain single. I’m too heartbroken to go through heartbreak again."</center></li>
